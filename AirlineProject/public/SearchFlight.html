  <summary>WELCOME TO CANADIAN AIRLINES:</summary>
  <p><i>Air Canada is the largest airline in Canada and is one of the founding members of the Star Alliance.
	 The company was established in 1937. 
	 Until 1964, it was called Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA). 
	 Already in 1937, the airline's aircraft began to perform inter continental flights.
	 At present, the planes fly all over Canada, as well as in the United States, Australia, Latin America, Europe and Asia.
	 During its history, the Air Canada logo has changed several times. But it has always remained concise. And the symbol of the country, the maple leaf, has always been in the center of attention. Thus, from 1937 to 1963 the Air Canada logo was a red maple leaf on the white background and was the exact copy of the national flag. This emphasized its position in the country, speaking of a leading position among all Canadian airlines.
